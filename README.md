# Algorithmic-trading-Istar-model
•	Formed an I-Star model for 50 stocks in order to determine the efficient frontier of all stocks and optimize the portfolio – calculated the best market impact and trading cost with linear regression, non-linear regression, non-linear regression with sampling

•	The I-Star portfolio realized an average profit of 5% in 15 trading days

Special thanks to professor Rober Kissell!
